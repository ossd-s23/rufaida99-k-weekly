## Reflections on Projects
I really liked quite a few of the projects, especially Oppia and Jupyter. I might even look at freecodecamp, font awesome and wordpress for individual contributions because they are all projects I am interested in. I am very excited about working in a team of like minded individuals on the same project and contribute in meaningful ways to it. I am a little behind on my individual contributions to open source projects, but I am starting to make more and gain a better understanding of open source projects and the communities involved.

## Challenges
I am quite scared of a few things - not getting a response on a contribution request, being told off or made to feel unwelcome, making unecessary edits or insignificant contributions, and possibly messing up code. I am also a tiny bit scared about the group aspect of the project, and making enough contributions within the group.  It is nice to word these out so I can address all of them one by one - I think the project evals have helped counter most of these, since picking the project itself will be mitigating these fears, as for the last part - messing up code - I know if the code doesn't work, it will not get approved and I won't be actually able to mess it up. I will get to learn from this process and become an active member of the open source community, and the best part is I will get to do it with people that care about the same stuff as me.
