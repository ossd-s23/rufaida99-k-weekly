Prompt: What are your thoughts about different projects that you have looked at so far? what are you most excited about regarding working on an opens source project? what do you think will be the biggest challenges? how do you plan to overcome them?

## Reflections on Projects
I really liked quite a few of the projects, especially Oppia and Jupyter. I am very excited about working in a team of like minded individuals on the same project and contribute in meaningful ways to it. I am a little behind on my own contributions to open source projects, but I am starting to make more and gain a better understanding of open source projects and the communities involved.

## Challenges
I am quite scared of a few things - not getting a response on a contribution request, being told off or made to feel unwelcome, making unecessary edits or insignificant contributions, and possibly messing up code. It is nice to word these out so I can address all of them one by one - I think the project evals have helped counter most of these, since picking the project itself will be mitigating these fears, as for the last part - messing up code - I know if the code doesn't work, it will not get approved and I won't be actually able to mess it up. I will get to learn from this process and become an active member of the open source community, and the best part is I will get to do it with people that care about the same stuff as me.
