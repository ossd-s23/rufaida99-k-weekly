## Reflections on Oppia Project

I am extremely happy to be working with the team I have, we are all familiar with each other, and are comfortable withe each others' technical skills and communication skills as well. We are interested in this project, and want to learn as much as possible to contribute meaningfully to Oppia. I like that we are all on the same page about keeping an open mind, being respectful of each others time and schedules, and also Oppia's guidelines and rules.

It is going well so far, we have had two meetings and are in the installation process at the time. Installation was not easy since there are a lot of steps involved, but we all got through the worst of it together. I am hopeful we will make decent contributions and actually get to know some of the developers as well in the process, and I am slightly worried we might make some silly mistake or ask a "stupid" question, but since we're all quite aware of each others weak spots, we have each others backs as well. I am hopeful we will continue on this trajectory and start making contributions soon.
