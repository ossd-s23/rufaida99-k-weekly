## Last Week - Presentation

<!--more-->
Ok so we were panicking but we prepared and practiced our presentation 4-5 times, and had a really fun time despite being nervous! I really enjoyed working with this group and did get emotional towards the end of the last lecture. This was the last lecture of my undergrad degree, and it's been such a long journey, I am so glad it's successfully complete. I am also really glad that I picked this class. It's been a welcoming and amazing experience all sem, and I am of course grateful to Professor Joanna for being so supporting and kind. :)
