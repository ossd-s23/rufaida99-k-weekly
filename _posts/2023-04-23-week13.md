## In-Class Discussion

So, I was running late and did miss the beginning of the lecture, but I did read the slides after and found a bunch of stuff interesting.

As for sharing open source across companies - I've grown up watching Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, and the Candy Industry wasn't big on "sharing" anything, I'd just assumed industries don't do that altogether.

## Group Project

We had a major breakthrough with our group project this week!!! We were able to find the exact documentation that would lead us to resolve our issues with finding the codebase. It was not straightforward though, because none of the issues addressed finding these internal pages that consisted of faulty code, we basically just kep exploring different parts of Oppia and came across the page. We were *really* happy about this development, and decided to divide and conquer with our group effort for the week. I paired up with Leah, and Nicole and Seoeun paired up together, and we were able to actually tackle 2 issues :)
We also found a few more we wanna work on, and possibly claiming a few issues we had looked at in these past few weeks. We may have to drop the idea of contributing to Documentation, considering we don't have screenshots and exact issues listed down, as we cannot possibly uninstall and re-install the software at this point to regain that proof. We are going to continue on our code contributions path, and hopefully make a difference to the project overall.
