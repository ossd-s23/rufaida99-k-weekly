## Reflections on Group Project

We are working well together on the contributions, and are trying our best to meet online/in-person regularly and communicate. So far, we have made 3 contributions, and are planning more during every meeting. We do want to eventually contribute a lesson plan to Oppia but are a little intimidated about doing that as of now. Hopefully we will get the knack of it soon.

## Reflections on Individual Contributions

I was able to make a few more contributions this week, and actually have an active contribution right now! I contributed to a project called Activist by posting an issue, and got immediate feedback from a maintainer (they are super friendly and welcoming), so I was really glad I found this project. I will continue to contribute to them in the meanwhile, and will be claiming a few issues this coming week as well.
