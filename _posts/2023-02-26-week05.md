## Discussion With Mek
I remember when Prof. Joanna discussed the Internet Archive with us in the first week of classes, and was very taken aback by the Wayback machine. I've never participated in a time capsule burial before, but it very much felt like I was a part of one now, and it was very exciting to see the older website pages for Yahoo, YouTube, and Limewire (I mostly used these websites when I was younger).

When Mek started talking about the message behind Internet Archive, the principle behind it, and his words about Aaron Swartz, I was very moved by the fact that despite living in a late-stage capitalist society today, we still have people who actually care about knowledge, and sharing that with an open-community the way the Internet Archive does, and are dedicating their time and energy towards sustaining this model.

As an avid bookreader, I was pretty excited about the book mapping, especially that of the older books that never got digitized and would be lost forever if not for these efforts. Learning about the process behind it, seeing the machines and the 3-D Map of the building itself was also quite cool. Thanks to Mek, I also learned about the Music Genome Project (Pandora)! It was a lovely discussion, and I look forward to browsing the Internet Archive a lot more, and perhaps contribute to it as well.
