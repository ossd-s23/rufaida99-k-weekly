title: Week 4 - Extension
---

## My Group (4)
I liked working with my team, because we all learned from each other and had an open mind. I think scheduling got a little tricky sometimes, which was a source of frustration at times, but we were able to work around it. I am glad that I was able to communicate my likes and dislikes well enough to the team, and we actually decided to go ahead with an extension idea that I proposed (with additional changes of course). I am somewhat familiar with javascript and extensions, and have some more experience with css, so I was able to contribtue in those terms. I am familiar with content scripts and background scripts, but did need a little brushing up for the extension. I did realize I have decent communication skills, and I was able to use them well. I like working in teams where everyone is on the same page, and ideally open-minded to different opinions.

## Other Projects

To be honest, all the other extensions were amazing! I wanted to install all of them, but in the end I stuck to TabColor because it was visually appealing. I don't usually use Mozilla, so I cannot say that I have any feedback on it, I just like the colours whenever I do use Mozilla, and would hope some of these would be compatible with Chrome as well! I also liked the Word Replacer, and Brightspace pdf viewer extensions.
