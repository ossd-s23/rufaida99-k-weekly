## Spring Break

I know we don't technically need to make a post for Spring Break, but I wanted to add a little note for my progress this week. I made a number of contributions, and learned how to make Wikipedia edits, OpenStreetMap edits as well as explore how to contribute to FreedCodeCamp. I'll make more contributions in the coming days, and am also happy with the progress of my group. :)
